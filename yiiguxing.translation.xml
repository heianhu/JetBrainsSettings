      <item value="I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9." />
      <item value="The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:" />
      <item value="Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four." />
      <item value="Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII." />
      <item value="Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M." />

      <item value="But for multiples of three it should output “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five output “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five output “FizzBuzz”." />
      <item value="Write a program that outputs the string representation of numbers from 1 to n." />

      <item value="Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police." />
      <item value="robbing" />
      <item value="You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night." />
      <item value="If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle." />
      <item value="Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum." />
      <item value="If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit." />
      <item value="Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times)." />
      <item value="as selling price needs to be larger than buying price." />
      <item value="Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one." />
      <item value="Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i." />
      <item value="Given n will be a positive integer." />

      <item value="You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which will return whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API." />
      <item value="Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad." />
      <item value="You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad." />
